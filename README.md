CoronaOuyaController
====================

OUYA Controller wrapper class for Corona SDK.

Corona SDK does not fully support Ouya as of 7/30/13. All of the buttons on the Ouya controller are recognized except for the analog sticks. The left analog stick acts like the control pad, but the right is not recognized at all. In addition the SDK does not support Ouya in-app purchases and the build process does not target their store.
